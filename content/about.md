# About The Nerd of All Trades

Welcome! I'm passionate about making, building, and sharing knowledge across multiple technical and creative domains. This blog represents my journey through DIY tech projects, hobby pursuits, and the practical solutions I've discovered along the way.

## My Background

My technical journey spans several areas:

**Home Server Infrastructure**: Building and maintaining personal server setups for data storage, media streaming, home automation, and development environments.

**Miniature Painting**: Developing skills in precision painting, color theory, weathering techniques, and bringing tabletop gaming miniatures to life.

**Electronics Projects**: Hands-on experience with circuit design, microcontroller programming, and custom control systems for various applications.

## Philosophy

Every piece of content on this site is grounded in real-world experience. I believe in:

- **Learning by doing**: Hands-on experience beats theoretical knowledge
- **Sharing the journey**: Including failures, challenges, and lessons learned
- **Practical solutions**: Focus on what actually works in the real world
- **Community building**: Learning from and teaching others in the maker community

## What Sets This Blog Apart

**Real Projects**: Every tutorial and guide comes from actual projects I've built, tested, and used.

**Complete Documentation**: I document the entire process, including planning, execution, troubleshooting, and results.

**Cost-Conscious Approach**: Finding the best balance between quality and budget, because not everyone has unlimited resources.

**Safety Focus**: Proper safety practices and procedures are always emphasized, especially in electronics work.

## Current Projects

I'm always working on something new. Current active projects include:

- Home server expansion and service optimization
- Elite Dangerous button box controller design
- Miniature painting technique refinement
- Electronics workbench organization and safety improvements

## Let's Connect

I love connecting with fellow makers, builders, and learners. Feel free to reach out with questions, project ideas, or just to share what you're working on.

## The Name

"The Nerd of All Trades" reflects my approach to learning and making â€“ diving deep into multiple technical and creative areas rather than specializing in just one. It's about being curious, hands-on, and always ready to tackle the next interesting challenge.

Thanks for visiting, and I hope you find something useful for your own making journey!
